                <b>Rise of a Maverick</b>
                <p className="fText"> On March 27, 2015, Weyland made his first billion thanks to the renewable energy gathered following the installation of solar panels that align and move in Earthâ€™s orbital plane but at an axial tilt, imitating a perpetual summer solstice. This is the first successfully industrialized space mission of the Weyland Corporation, which receives funding from a trio of major venture capital firms. On February 2, 2016, he effectively ended global warming by generating a localized synthetic atmosphere above the polar ice caps using a precursor to the atmospheric processor of his own invention. Three months later, at the age of 26, Sir Peter Weyland became one of the youngest people ever to achieve a knighthood.</p>
